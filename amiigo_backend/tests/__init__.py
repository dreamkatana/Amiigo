# This file makes the 'tests' directory a Python package.
# It's generally kept empty or might contain package-level test configurations if needed.

# You can set global pytest configurations or fixtures here, but `conftest.py`
# is the more standard place for pytest fixtures.
# ``` # Removed offending backticks that caused SyntaxError
