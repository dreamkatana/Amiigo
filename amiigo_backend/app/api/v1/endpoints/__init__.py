# This file makes the 'endpoints' directory a Python package.

# You can import individual routers here for convenience if you prefer,
# though often they are imported directly in `app/api/v1/api.py`.

# Example:
# from .users import router as users_router
# from .login import router as login_router
# ... and so on for other endpoint modules

# __all__ = [
#     "users_router",
#     "login_router",
# ]

# print("API v1 endpoints package initialized.")
# ``` # Removed offending backticks
