# This file makes the 'api' directory a Python package.

# You might import the main API router here for convenience if needed,
# though often it's imported directly in main.py.

# from .v1.api import api_router_v1 # Example, will be uncommented later

# print("API package initialized.")
# ``` # Removed offending backticks
