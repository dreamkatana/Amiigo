# This file makes the 'core' directory a Python package.
# It can also be used to easily import items from its modules.
# For example:
# from .config import settings
# from .security import verify_password, get_password_hash

# This allows you to do `from app.core import settings` instead of `from app.core.config import settings`
# We will uncomment these as we define them.
