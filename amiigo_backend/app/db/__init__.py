# This file makes the 'db' directory a Python package.

# For easier imports of common database-related items:
# from .session import SessionLocal, engine # Will be uncommented once session.py is created
# from .base_class import Base # Will be uncommented once base_class.py is created

# You might also initialize your database tables here if you're not using Alembic
# or want to ensure tables are created on startup for development.
# Example:
# from .base_class import Base
# from .session import engine
# from app.models.user import User # Assuming User model exists
#
# def init_db():
#     Base.metadata.create_all(bind=engine)
#
# Call init_db() from main.py on startup if needed.
# However, for production and robust schema management, Alembic is preferred.
# ``` # Removed offending backticks
